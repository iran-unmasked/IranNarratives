# Iran Narratives

**Iran Narratives** is an open-source project created in response to mass state violence and systematic repression in Iran, and the sustained manipulation of information used to deny, justify, or erase those crimes.

## Why this project exists

Over the past decades, and especially during recent uprisings, **more than 12,000 Iranians have been killed** as a result of state violence, including shootings, torture, executions, and deaths in detention. Thousands more have been imprisoned, disappeared, or forced into silence.

Alongside physical repression, the Iranian state and its supporters have waged a parallel war on truth:  
denying killings, blaming victims, manufacturing consent, spreading disinformation, and attacking those who speak out.

**Iran Narratives exists because silence, distortion, and propaganda are tools of violence.**

This project was created to confront that information violence directly.

## What this project does

- Documents and analyzes dominant narratives used to deny, justify, or normalize repression  
- Tracks disinformation campaigns and coordinated messaging related to Iran  
- Exposes narrative patterns that target protesters, minorities, journalists, and victims  
- Preserves evidence-based analysis in an open, transparent, and reproducible way  
- Supports accountability by making manipulation visible and traceable  

## What this project stands for

- **Truth over propaganda**
- **Victims over power**
- **Evidence over denial**
- **Justice over silence**

This project does not claim neutrality in the face of mass killing.  
It claims **integrity, transparency, and responsibility**.

## What this project is not

- Not affiliated with any government or political organization  
- Not an intelligence or surveillance operation  
- Not a platform for harassment or doxxing  
- Not a space for denial of documented atrocities  

## Ethics and data use

All analysis is based on **publicly available information**.  
The project avoids publishing private or sensitive personal data and does not target private individuals.

Narrative analysis is conducted to expose systems of power and manipulation—not to endanger civilians.

## Disclaimer

Iran Narratives is an independent, open-source initiative.  
Responsibility for analysis lies with individual contributors.  
The project exists to document, analyze, and resist information manipulation—not to incite harm.

## Call to action

If you are a researcher, journalist, data scientist, developer, or witness:  
your skills matter.

Truth survives when it is documented, shared, and defended.
